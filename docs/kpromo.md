# kpromo - Artifact promoter

kpromo is a tool responsible for artifact promotion.

It has two operation modes:

- `run` - Execute a file promotion (formerly "promobot-files") (image promotion coming soon)
- `manifest` - Generate/modify a file manifest to target for promotion (image support coming soon)

Expectations:

- `kpromo run` should only be run in auditable environments
- `kpromo manifest` should primarily be run by contributors

- [File promotion](#file-promotion)

## File promotion
