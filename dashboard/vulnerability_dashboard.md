# Image Vulnerability Dashboard
The vulnerability dashboard is intended to surface the vulnerabilities of 
images in the Kubernetes production project - k8s-artifacts-prod. The
dashboard operates as a static HTML page hosted on Google Cloud Storage.
It can be accessed by visiting this
[page](https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-artifacts-prod-vuln-dashboard/dashboard.html).

## Information Flow

### CAS Adapter
The dashboard utilizes the Container Analysis Service in order to actually get
the vulnerabilities it displays. However, the vulnerability information can't be used
as provided by CAS. This is because CAS provides lots of unnecessary information which
make it difficult to parse into an HTML table; not to mention, the large file size due
to the sheer amount of information for each of Kubernetes' production images.

In order to use this information, we use an adapter which processes the vulnerability
occurrences returned from the CAS into a new
[struct](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/k8s-container-image-promoter/blob/master/dashboard/adapter/types.go)
containing only the info that the dashboard needs in order to create its table. This
information is then uploaded as a JSON file to Google Cloud Storage, where it can be parsed
into an easy-to-read HTML table. The adapter is implemented in
[adapter.go](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/k8s-container-image-promoter/blob/master/dashboard/adapter/adapter.go).

### JS Parser
The CAS adapter described above writes the processed vulnerability information to a JSON
stored in the vulnerability dashbaord's GCS bucket. In order to convert this JSON to a
HTML table, a simple JavaScript file is also placed in the GCS bucket which can read in
the contents of the JSON and create the table.

The most updated versions of both the
[JavaScript](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/k8s-container-image-promoter/blob/master/dashboard/dashboard.js)
file and the static
[HTML](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/k8s-container-image-promoter/blob/master/dashboard/dashboard.html)
page are also uploaded to Google Cloud Storage whenever the adapter runs.

## Integration With Prow
In order to have the dashboard display the most up to date vulnerability information
from the Container Analysis Service, a
[periodic](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/prow/jobs.md)
Prow job has been set up -
[k8sio-vuln-dashboard-cron](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/config/jobs/kubernetes/test-infra/test-infra-trusted.yaml).
This Prow job runs once every 24 hours, and runs the adapter in order to get the most
recent vulnerabilities and upload any new updates to the dashboard files stored in
Google Cloud Storage.
